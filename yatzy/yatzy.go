/*
The game of Yatzy is a simple dice game. Each player rolls five six-sided dice. 
They can re-roll some or all of the dice up to three times (including the original roll).

The player then places the roll in a category, such as ones, twos, fives, pair, two pairs etc (see the rules below). 
If the roll is compatible with the category, the player gets a score for the roll according to the rules. 
If the roll is not compatible with the category, the player scores zero for the roll.

For example, suppose a player scores 5,6,5,5,2 in the fives category they would score 15 (three fives). 
The score for that go is then added to their total and the category cannot be used again in the remaining goes for that game. 
A full game consists of one go for each category. Thus, for their last go in a game, a player must choose their only remaining category.

Your task is to score a GIVEN roll in a GIVEN category. You do NOT have to program the random dice rolling. 
The game is NOT played by letting the computer choose the highest scoring category for a given roll.
